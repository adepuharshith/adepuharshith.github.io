  description: Architectured materials exhibit negative PoissonQs
ratios and enhanced mechanical properties compared with
regular materials. Their auxetic behaviors emerge from
periodic cellular structures regardless of the materials used.
The majority of such metamaterials are constructed by topdown
approaches and macroscopic with unit cells of microns
or larger. There are also molecular auxetics including natural
crystals which are not designable. There is a gap from few
nanometers to microns, which may be filled by biomolecular
self-assembly. Herein, we demonstrate two-dimensional auxetic
nanostructures using DNA origami. Structural reconfigurations
are performed by two-step DNA reactions and
complemented by mechanical deformation studies using
molecular dynamics simulations. We find that the auxetic
behaviors are mostly defined by geometrical designs, yet the
properties of the materials also play an important role. From
elasticity theory, we introduce design principles for auxetic
DNA metamaterials.

  description: Chemotactic cell motility plays a critical role in many biological functions, such as immune response and
embryogenesis. Constructing synthetic cell-mimicking systems, such as a dynamic protocell, likewise requires molecular
mechanisms that respond to environmental stimuli and execute programmed motility behaviors. Although various molecular
components were proposed to achieve diverse functions in synthetic protocells, chemotactic motility on surfaces has not been
reported thus far. Here we show directional motility in synthetic lipid vesicles capable of chasing each other by programming
DNA components. We demonstrate that the “follow” vesicle recognizes and migrates along the moving trajectory of the “lead”
vesicle with an enhanced speed, thus mimicking natural chemotaxis in cell migration. This work provides new possibilities for
building synthetic protocells with complex functions such as programmed morphogenesis and cooperative motion. With the
vast library of dynamic DNA components, we envision that this platform will enable new discoveries in fundamental sciences
and novel applications in biotechnology.

  description: Intracellular protein motors have evolved to perform specific
tasks critical to the function of cells such as intracellular trafficking
and cell division1,2. Kinesin and dynein motors, for
example, transport cargoes in living cells by walking along
microtubules powered by adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis3,4.
These motors can make discrete 8 nm centre-of-mass steps
and can travel over 1 mm by changing their conformations
during the course of adenosine triphosphate binding, hydrolysis
and product release5,6. Inspired by such biological machines,
synthetic analogues have been developed including selfassembled
DNA walkers that can make stepwise movements
on RNA/DNA substrates7–12 or can function as programmable
assembly lines13. Here, we show that motors based on RNAcleaving
DNA enzymes14 can transport nanoparticle
cargoes—CdS nanocrystals in this case—along single-walled
carbon nanotubes. Our motors extract chemical energy from
RNA molecules decorated on the nanotubes and use that
energy to fuel autonomous, processive walking through a
series of conformational changes along the one-dimensional
track. The walking is controllable and adapts to changes in
the local environment, which allows us to remotely direct ‘go’
and ‘stop’ actions. The translocation of individual motors can
be visualized in real time using the visible fluorescence of the
cargo nanoparticle and the near-infared emission of the
carbon-nanotube track.We observed unidirectional movements
of the molecular motors over 3 mm with a translocation velocity
on the order of 1 nm min21 under our experimental conditions.

  description: Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals heterostructures from transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC)
semiconductors show spatially separate excitons with extraordinary properties. The interlayer excitons (XI) have been studied
extensively, yet the mechanisms that modulate XI are still not well understood. Here, we introduce several organic-layer-embedded
hybrid heterostructures, MoS2/organic/WSe2, to study the binding energy of XI. We discover that the dielectric screening of the
quasiparticle is reduced with organic molecules due to a decreased dielectric constant and greater separation distance between the
TMDC layers. As a result, a distinct blueshift is observed in interlayer emission. We also find that the band alignment at the
heterointerface is critical. When the organic layer provides a staggered energy state, interlayer charge transfer can transition from
tunneling to band-assisted transfer, further increasing XI emission energies due to a stronger dipolar interaction. The formation of XI
may also be significantly suppressed with electron or hole trapping molecules. These findings should be useful in realizing XI-based
optoelectronics.
