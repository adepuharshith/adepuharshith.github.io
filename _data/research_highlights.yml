  description: Architectured materials exhibit negative PoissonQs ratios and enhanced mechanical properties compared with regular materials. Their auxetic behaviors emerge from periodic cellular structures regardless of the materials used. The majority of such metamaterials are constructed by topdown approaches and macroscopic with unit cells of microns or larger. From elasticity theory, we introduce design principles for auxetic DNA metamaterials.

  description: Chemotactic cell motility plays a critical role in many biological functions, such as immune response and embryogenesis. Constructing synthetic cell-mimicking systems, such as a dynamic protocell, likewise requires molecular mechanisms that respond to environmental stimuli and execute programmed motility behaviors. With the vast library of dynamic DNA components, we envision that this platform will enable new discoveries in fundamental sciences and novel applications in biotechnology.

  description: Intracellular protein motors have evolved to perform specific tasks critical to the function of cells such as intracellular trafficking and cell division1,2. Inspired by such biological machines, synthetic analogues have been developed including selfassembled DNA walkers that can make stepwise movements on RNA/DNA substrates7–12 or can function as programmable assembly lines13. The walking is controllable and adapts to changes in the local environment, which allows us to remotely direct ‘go’ and ‘stop’ actions.

  description: Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals heterostructures from transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) semiconductors show spatially separate excitons with extraordinary properties. The interlayer excitons (XI) have been studied extensively, yet the mechanisms that modulate XI are still not well understood. Here, we introduce several organic-layer-embedded hybrid heterostructures, MoS2/organic/WSe2, to study the binding energy of XI. We discover that the dielectric screening of the quasiparticle is reduced with organic molecules due to a decreased dielectric constant and greater separation distance between the TMDC layers. As a result, a distinct blueshift is observed in interlayer emission.  These findings should be useful in realizing XI-based optoelectronics.
